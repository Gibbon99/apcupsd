APC UPS plugin for OPNsense

Plugin Changelog
================
1.1 - Some small changes incl. code cleanup and adding more parameters.

1.0	- Initial release

"apcupsd" can be used for controlling all APC UPS models. It can monitor and log the current power 
and battery status, perform automatic shutdown, and can run in network mode in order to power down 
other hosts on a LAN.

This plugin allows you to configure a APC UPS for use with OPNsense using the APCUPSD project.
The setup page allows you to set the most common options for connecting your UPS to your OPNsense 
router and a status page for UPS status. Also includes support to act as APC Netserver.

Additional information:
I use the OPNsense monit service to control the running of the apcupsd service.  
You will need to enable the APC Netserver if you would like the service to be restarted should 
it crash or is not running the monit daemon polls the UPS service on port 3551 ( default ) to 
see if it is running or not.

The monit service can be configured:
You can add a new Service Test to ensure that the apcupsd daemon starts up, and Monit will restart 
it should it crash.
