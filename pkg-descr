1.0	- Initial release

"apcupsd" can be used for controlling all APC UPS models. It can monitor and log the current power and battery status, perform automatic shutdown,
and can run in network mode in order to power down other hosts on a LAN.

This plugin allows you to configure an APC UPS for use with OPNsense using the APCUPSD project. The setup page allows you to set the most common options
for connecting your UPS to your OPNsense router and a status page for the UPS status. It also includes support to act as an APC Netserver.

Additional information:
This package does not come with a script to start the APCUPS daemon, it is recommended to use the OPNsense monit service to control the running
of the apcupsd service.

The apcupsd daemon can be monitored via it's PID file ( /var/run/apcupsd.pid ) with the type set to "Process". Start and Stop can be set to:

Start: /usr/sbin/service apcupsd start
Stop: /usr/sbin/service apcupsd stop
